# Things to this year

I am starting a project which is having a cutting edge stack

```Javascript
monorepo
 -- docs (docsify)
 -- frontend (nextjs)
 -- backend (nestjs)
 -- database (mongodb)
 -- docker
 -- kubernetes
```

## docsify

this a static site document generator where developer will write the documentation while developing itself for both user and for the team

## nextjs

this will be coming into 2 parts

1. while developing the frontend application it talks with backend and serves as frontend to the sass
2. it also comes for the work in the static site development

## nestjs

this is complete typescript to develop big and complex backend projects

## monogodb

nosql database

## docker

all this things are getting handled by docker in local and in the environments

## kubernetes

we need to do orchestration in kubernetes
